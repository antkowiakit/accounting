#Agency Core Accounting Interface
Simple PHP abstracts, interfaces and traits that ensure each of our accounting API wrappers (for Xero, FreeAgent and Kashflow) all follow the same format.

##Installation

    composer require agencycore/accounting

##Usage

The abstractions and interfaces developed here allow us to create wrappers for every major accounting package that have the same find, create, update and delete interface.

Here are our wrappers:

* [Xero](https://github.com/agencycore/xero)
* [FreeAgent](https://github.com/agencycore/freeagent)
* [Kashflow](https://github.com/agencycore/kashflow)
